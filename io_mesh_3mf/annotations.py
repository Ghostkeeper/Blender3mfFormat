    This is a collection of annotations for a 3MF document. It annotates the files in the archive with metadata
    information.

    The class contains serialisation and deserialization functions in order to be able to load and save the annotations
    from/to a 3MF archive, and to load and save the annotations in the Blender scene.

    The annotations are stored in the `self.annotations` dictionary. The keys of this dictionary are the targets of the
    annotations, normally the files in this archive. It can be any URI however, and the files don't necessarily need to
    exist.

    The values are sets of annotations. The annotations are named tuples as described in the beginning of this module.
    The set can contain any mixture of these named tuples. Duplicates will get filtered out by the nature of the set
    data structure.
